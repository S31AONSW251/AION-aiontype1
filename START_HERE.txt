## 🎯 AION CONSCIOUSNESS INTEGRATION

### What Gets Connected
```
Soul State (Mood/Emotion)
        ↓
    Math Panel
        ↓
    ├─ Generates AI-aware hints
    ├─ Adapts problem difficulty
    ├─ Tracks learning progress
    └─ Updates mood on solve
        ↓
Learning Events Logged
```

### How It Works
1. **Low Mood** → Simpler hints, encouragement
2. **Neutral Mood** → Balanced hints
3. **High Mood** → Challenging hints, advanced approaches

4. **Solving Problems** → Mood increases (especially for complex)
5. **Tracking Learning** → All events logged to consciousness
6. **Adaptation** → Future hints personalized
